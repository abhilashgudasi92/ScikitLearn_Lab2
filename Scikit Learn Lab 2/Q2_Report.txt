Applying MNB to Real Dataset

Dataset chosen: Twitter U.S. Semtiment Analysis

Best parameters MNB Algorithm
alpha with value 0.01

With MNB, the best score/accuracy we got, 77.45%

We are not satisfied with the accuracy.

Before preprocessing and after preprocessing the tweet text data, we did not see much improvement in the accuracy.

We can improve the accuracy with a linear support machine(SVM) by playing with parameters such as loss, alpha, penalty, maximum iterations, etc. For text processing, SVM seems to be better than MNB.
